# Deep Learning Based High Accuracy Real World Localization in Indoor mmWave Networks With Virtual Anchors
This repository contains code and documentation for an indoor localization system using mmWave (millimeter-wave) sensor data. The project explores how to leverage mmWave signals to estimate positions of targets or obstacles within indoor environments. By combining signal processing, feature extraction, and machine learning techniques, the system can achieve localization with reasonable accuracy even in cluttered or dynamic indoor settings.
